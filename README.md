Introduction:
This application reads data from an SQS queue (using Localstack), transforms the data (specifically masking PII), and then writes the data to a Postgres database.

Setting Up:
Ensure you have Docker, Docker Compose, awscli-local, and psql installed on your machine.

Run the provided docker-compose.yaml file using:
docker-compose up

Clone the provided code repository and navigate to the directory.

Run pip install boto3 psycopg2 to install the necessary Python libraries.

Running the Application:
From the repository directory, run:
python etl.py

Answers to the Questions:

Deployment: I would use a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes for deploying this application in production. It will make scaling, rolling updates, and monitoring easier.
Production Ready: Add error handling, retries for failures, logging, and monitoring.
Scaling: Utilize multiple worker pods/instances. Also, ensure the Postgres database is set up for high availability and can handle many concurrent write operations.
Recovering PII: The PII cannot be recovered from the masked values since a non-reversible hash function is used. If recovery is needed, we would need to change the approach, maybe using encryption.
Assumptions: The provided localstack and postgres images work as expected. The SQS queue doesn't have a massive number of messages that can overwhelm the script in one go.
Notes:
The provided solution is an iterative approach and might need optimizations for processing large volumes of messages.
While the sha256 function provides a consistent hash, remember that with enough data and time, hash collisions can theoretically occur.
Consider adding a mechanism to gracefully stop the script, perhaps listening for a keyboard interrupt or signal.# fetch_etl
